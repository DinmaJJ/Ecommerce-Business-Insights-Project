Ecommerce Business Insights Project

This data analytics project leverages Python and SQL to analyze an e-commerce dataset and generate actionable business insights. Python was used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and building an ETL pipeline for thorough data cleaning, while SQL supported deeper analytical queries and validation. Visualizations and modeling were performed using Plotly and predictive models to analyze churn and customer lifetime value (LTV).

Project Overview

The e-commerce business maintains steady sales but lacks clear visibility into customer behavior, service performance, and revenue drivers. This project aims to:

Understand customer retention and churn patterns

Identify revenue drivers and product performance

Analyze operational efficiency and fulfillment bottlenecks

Forecast financial trends and model customer lifetime value

Key Business Questions & Insights
1. Customer Retention and Segmentation

Monthly churn trends show a stable customer base between 2024–2025, with occasional dips indicating effective reactivation campaigns.

Churn drivers: Low credit tiers, high shipping costs, and non-subscribers have higher churn risk.

Regional insights: Peru and Bahrain generate the highest total revenue; Bahrain and Barbados have highest revenue per customer.

Top customers: High LTV correlates with credit tiers A/B and newsletter subscriptions. Retention programs should target these segments.

2. Product Performance

Top performers: Products like PROD002487–PROD002126 drive strong revenue and margins.

Critical failures: PROD000419 shows negative revenue, highlighting returns or pricing issues.

Low-performing products: Bottom 5% products with poor ratings should be reviewed or cleared.

3. Operations & Fulfillment

Delivery speed: Extremely long delivery times correlate with low ratings.

Warehouse performance: All warehouses show ~65% on-time delivery; systemic inefficiencies need addressing.

Payment failures: Cash and PayPal exhibit highest failure rates; digital wallets perform best.

4. Financial Trends

Sales and profits declined ~50% between 2024 and 2025.

Currency impact: USD dominates sales but yields weaker margins; EUR and GBP are more profitable.

Customer tiers: Most revenue comes from a small group of high-spending customers, highlighting opportunities for tier migration programs.

5. Churn & LTV Modeling

Churn predictors: Customer inactivity (no purchases >180 days) is the strongest predictor.

LTV insights: High-value but infrequent buyers represent significant revenue potential.

Models show high reliability (churn accuracy = 1.0, LTV R² = 0.99), enabling targeted retention and revenue forecasting.

Recommendations

Prioritize retention and LTV-driven growth over new customer acquisition.

Apply segmented engagement strategies for high-value and low-value customers.

Improve fulfillment reliability to boost satisfaction and trust.

Eliminate or restructure loss-making products and focus on profitable offerings.

Promote high-performing payment methods to reduce transaction failures.

Invest in loyalty programs, personalization, and customer tier migration.

Expand into higher-margin regions and currencies to improve profitability.
